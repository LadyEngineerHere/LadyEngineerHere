Hi there! My name is Amanda, aka LadyEnginerHere. I'm a self-taught programmer who loves to create exciting projects that make everyday life simpler and more fun. I enjoy exploring different programming languages and frameworks, and I'm always on the lookout for new challenges to tackle. I hope my projects can inspire and motivate others to pursue their own coding dreams!
Please feel free to check out my projects and get in touch if you have any questions or ideas. I'm always open to collaboration and eager to learn from others. Let's build something awesome together!
